AUTO is a project of the system of full autonomous electric cabs running in [Pozna≈Ñ](https://goo.gl/maps/JcykRLkoVo22) featuring integrated simulator of vehicles and sample front-end. It also has integrated generator of random orders for rides.

## About
![AUTO features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakubriegel/AUTO/master/docs/features.png)


## Implementation
System is implemented 100% in C++ with additional frameworks: [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl), [cURLpp](https://github.com/jpbarrette/curlpp) and [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow). Front-end is written is [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). Map service is provided by Google Maps API.

Core of the app is based on modular structure. Main app is an object of class **AUTO**, from whitch other modules expand. They are: 
* **server** - a Crow application serving AUTO web app and JSON API
* **simulator of cars and bases** - here all of cars and bases logic happens
* **requests genetator** - generates random orders for rides, so that it can be seen, how the system could work in real life

Each of them is implemented as a thread. **AUTO** is where main logic happens. It receives data from other modules, process it and send dispositions to the modules back.

External modules of the system are: 
* **config.json** - the app reads it each time it starts. This file stores all paremeters of the system, such as: cars number, bases locations, service area...
* **TypeScript web app** - here the logic of sample front-end is implemented
* **html template** and other **static files** for web app

Majority of code is explained by in-line comments. 

## Try it!
You can get hands on it here: [auto.jrie.eu](http://auto.jrie.eu/). 

AUTO web application is just a sample of how could user-side of such system look. It is working on desktop and mobile, but proper functionality is only available in Google Chrome.

## Build and run it yourself

Necessary dependencies are g++, cURL and cURLpp. The app also uses Crow and nlohmann::json, but they are provided in this repository.

AUTO was implemented using Visual Studio Code. This repository contains configuration files for it.


### Compiling 
First you need to compile TypeScript. Type `tsc` in the Terminal. Afer it you are ready to start C++ compilation with: `g++ app.cpp includes/implementation/*.cpp -o AUTO -std=c++11 -lboost_system -lpthread -lcurlpp -lcurl `

### Running
Type: `sudo ./AUTO config.json`
