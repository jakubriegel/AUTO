AUTO is a project of the system of full autonumous electric cabs running in [Pozna≈Ñ](https://goo.gl/maps/JcykRLkoVo22) featuring integrated simulator of vehicles and sample front-end. It also has integrated generator of random orders for rides.

## Implementation
System is implemented 100% in C++ with additional frameworks: [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl), [cURLpp](https://github.com/jpbarrette/curlpp) and [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow). Front-end is written is [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript). Map service is provided by Google Maps API. 

Code is explained by in-line comments. As AUTO is still in development phase more documentation will be added in the future.

## Try it!
You can get hands on it here: [auto.jrie.eu](http://auto.jrie.eu/). Have in mind, that some system down time is possible.
